# Our Principles

### A design system your devs will love
An essential toolkit that's built to simplify communication between designers and developers, ensuring your product gets built quickly and accurately

### Production-ready from the get-to
Every component and its variations come hand-in-hand with a dedicated story in Storybook. Each prop is meticulously matched in terminology to React, and correlated props are clearly marked. 

This lets designers and developers speak the same language, clearing up any confusion and keeping everyone on the same page. With common terms and practices, product teams can speed up their work, making Functional UI Kit your go-to for smooth teamwork.

### Figma variables match CSS variables
We've made sure that Figma variables and CSS variables work together effortlessly. They share the same names, usage and inheritance structure. This isn't just an extra feature; it's the core approach.

Each Figma variable has a direct counterpart in CSS, so there's no confusion. Your design ideas stay crystal clear as you move into the development phase.

### All the essentials, meticulously built
Our kit covers all the fundamental components you need, available in both light and dark modes. These components are designed with precision and adhere to WCAG accessibility guidelines.

Every component is crafted with a deep understanding of UX principles and best practices. Colors and sizes are chosen with accessibility in mind. You can be confident that your designs will not only be visually appealing but also usable by a wide range of users.

### Harmony in Design and Code
Our toolkit shields you from style side effects, maintains typographic consistency, mirrors CSS structure with Auto Layout, simplifies copy-pasting, eliminates guesswork and efficiently organizes colors.

### We stick to simple & fundamental design rules
Our components follow the functional guidelines for creating intuitive, accessible, and stunning interfaces outlined in [Practical UI book](https://www.practical-ui.com/).
